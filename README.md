### what I learned

This was my first project on React JS and I enjoyed it. I got a good grasp of how React works differently from Vanilla JS. It took time to get used to rendering things and dynamically update data using hooks but dividing whole website into smaller components was a big help.

### Useful resources
- [Build a React Accordion Component Dropdown from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNKbo0bboyA&t=829s) - It was tricky to use index values to trigger accordion open or close action.
- [Convert numbers into a currency format using JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7VVvJAsXWg&t=2s) - This was really helpful to convert big numbers into currency format.
